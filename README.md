# Caoyu819-protocols-for-karst-adaptation-of-Platycarya

This repository include the main scripts used in the paper: Chromosome-level genome assemblies and population-genomic analyses shed light on adaptation to karst and incipient speciation of the genus Platycarya (Juglandaceae)

The main analysis include:
1. population genomics analysis (population_structure, recombination_rate, ms_simulation)
2. positive selection detection (selection_detection)
3. comparative genomics analysis (Gene_Expansion_Contraction)
4. transcriptome analysis (transcriptome_analysis)


Under each directory, the shell script named pipeline.sh is the main pipeline for that specific analysis, other perl or python or shell scripts were called by pipeline.sh.
